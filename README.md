rpmsnap
=======

A simple set of scripts to compare the contents of RPM databases on different machines, or 
on the same machine at different times.

There are three scripts:

<table>

<tr>
<td>rpmsnap.pl</td>
<td>Access the RPM database using the `rpm` command and create a human-readable summary of its contents.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>makesnap.sh</td>
<td>This script runs `rpmsnap.pl`; it should be run regularly from cron to create regular summaries which can 
accumulate in a directory, tagged by creation date.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>rpmsnapcmp.pl</td>
<td>Takes two summaries created by `rpmsnap.pl` and compares the contents, writing out any differences found.</td>
</tr>

</table>

Suggestion for use if you have several machines
===============================================

Suppose you have three machines called hostname1, hostname2 and hostname3. 

On one machine, install a directory tree that looks like this:

    rpm/
    ├── bin/
    │   └── rpmsnapcmp.pl
    ├── data/
    │   ├── hostname1/
    │   ├── hostname2/
    │   └── hostname3/
    └── sbin/
        ├── makesnap.sh
        ├── prelinkfix.sh
        └── rpmsnap.pl

Now share this directory tree using a versioning system like `subversion` among all machines.
Make sure `makesnap.sh` is called on all three machines via cron (not necessarily as root).
Then summaries and files listing errors will generate under the hostname-specific directories.
Note that summaries will only be created if there are differences relative to the latest summary.

If you now share the files via the versioning system, it is easy to check RPM database differences
from any machine (or you can use a network file system, of course).
