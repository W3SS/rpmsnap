rpmsnap
=======

A simple set of scripts to compare the contents of RPM databases on different machines, or 
on the same machine at different times.

There are three scripts:

<table>

<tr>
<td>rpmsnap.pl</td>
<td>Access the RPM database using the `rpm` command and create a human-readable summary of its contents.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>makesnap.sh</td>
<td>This script runs `rpmsnap.pl`; it should be run regularly from cron to create regular summaries which can 
accumulate in a directory, tagged by creation date.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>rpmsnapcmp.pl</td>
<td>Takes two summaries created by `rpmsnap.pl` and compares the contents, writing out any differences found.</td>
</tr>

</table>

Suggestion for use if you have several machines
-----------------------------------------------

Suppose you have three machines called hostname1, hostname2 and hostname3. 

On one machine, install a directory tree that looks like this:

    rpm/
    ├── bin/
    │   └── rpmsnapcmp.pl
    ├── data/
    │   ├── hostname1/
    │   ├── hostname2/
    │   └── hostname3/
    └── sbin/
        ├── makesnap.sh
        ├── prelinkfix.sh
        └── rpmsnap.pl

Share and synchronized this directory tree among all the machines by putting it on a network file
system or by using a versioning system.

Make sure `makesnap.sh` is called regularly (for example, every 2nd day) on all three machines
via cron (not necessarily as root) by a suitable crontab entry.

Then summaries and files listing errors encountered during generation will accumulate under the
hostname-specific directories. `makesnap.sh` makes sure that a new summary is only kept 
if there are differences relative to the previous summary. For example, the tree may look like this
after some time:

    rpm/
    ├── bin
    │   └── rpmsnapcmp.pl
    ├── data
    │   ├── hostname1
    │   │   ├── rpmsnap.2012-10-04_17:00:01.err
    │   │   ├── rpmsnap.2012-10-04_17:00:01.txt
    │   │   ├── rpmsnap.2012-12-04_17:00:01.err
    │   │   └── rpmsnap.2012-12-04_17:00:01.txt
    │   ├── hostname2
    │   |   ├── rpmsnap.2013-02-13_17:00:01.txt
    │   │   ├── rpmsnap.2013-02-19_17:00:01.txt
    │   │   ├── rpmsnap.2013-03-01_17:00:01.err
    │   │   └── rpmsnap.2013-03-01_17:00:01.txt   
    │   └── hostname3
    │       ├── rpmsnap.2013-02-19_17:00:01.err
    │       ├── rpmsnap.2013-02-19_17:00:01.txt
    │       ├── rpmsnap.2013-02-22_17:00:01.txt
    │       └── rpmsnap.2013-02-25_17:00:02.txt
    └── sbin
        ├── makesnap.sh
        ├── prelinkfix.sh
        └── rpmsnap.pl

As the directory tree is synchronized among all the machines, it is easy to check for RPM database
differences from any machine.

The summary files "rpmsnap.YYYY-MM-DD_hh:mm:ss.txt" contain long lines like these:
